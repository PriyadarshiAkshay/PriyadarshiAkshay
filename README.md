# 👨‍🔬 Akshay Priyadarshi | Astrophysics PhD Researcher

## 🌌 About Me
I'm a PhD researcher in Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, with a background in physics and computer science from NISER Bhubaneswar. I develop Python packages for exoplanet studies, like TransitFit for transmission spectroscopy and exoplanet demographics simulator. I have experience in teaching physics, laboratory demonstrations, and assessing and providing feedback to students. I am also involved in scientific outreach, having organized and presented at different conferences and public events.

## 🚀 Current Projects
- 🪐 Building an exoplanet population model
- 🌠 Enhancing TransitFit for more accurate exoplanet analysis
