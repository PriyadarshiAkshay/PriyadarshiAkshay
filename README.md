# 👨‍🔬 Akshay Priyadarshi | Astrophysics PhD Researcher

## 🌌 About Me
I'm a PhD researcher in Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, with a background in physics and computer science from NISER Bhubaneswar. I develop Python packages for exoplanet studies, like TransitFit for transmission spectroscopy and exoplanet demographics simulator. I have experience in teaching physics, laboratory demonstrations, and assessing and providing feedback to students. I am also involved in scientific outreach, having organized and presented at different conferences and public events.

## 🚀 Current Projects
- 🪐 [TransitFit](https://github.com/SPEARNET/TransitFit): A Python package for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy
- 🌠 Exoplanet population model for demographic studies
- 🤖 AI Response and Code Evaluator at DataAnnotation (Part-time)
